\title{One Population Mean - Confidence Interval}
\usage{
Mean.1Pop.CI(xbar, variance, n, popVarKnown = F, alpha = 0.05,
  one.sided = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{xbar}{the mean of the sample}

\item{variance}{either the sample or population variance (the latter only if it is known)}

\item{n}{the size of the sample}

\item{popVarKnown}{boolean denoting whether the population variance is known. False by default.}

\item{alpha}{the significance level. Set to 0.05 by default.}

\item{one.sided}{boolean denoting whether the function should return one-sided confidence intervals. False by default.}
}
\value{
The confidence interval(s): one-sided lower and upper bounds (in a list) or just the two-sided confidence interval (as a simple vector).
}
\description{
Constructs a 100(1-alpha) percent confidence interval for a single population mean
